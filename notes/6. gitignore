Creating ".gitignore" : touch .gitignore 

We use ".gitignore" file to prevent git from tracking certain (large) files.
    by either using their name.ext (filename.dat)
    or by using their extension pattern (ex: *.dat)
    we can also ignore the folders (venv) -> (ex: foldername/)


We just type that file name into it and then git stops tracking it.

We also ignore the virtual-env as its got information about packages installed on your local devices, which can change from computer to computer.




# EX: if I've ignored all the .log files there are but I want one .log file to be tracked then I can do this:
    *.log
    ! important.log
