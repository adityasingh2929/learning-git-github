Branches are created from master branch, they're basically copies of master branch which are worked on and later after the work (feature,etc) is done, is merged into the main branch, This can have further two more cases:
    1. Main branch got updated and its branch also got updated but while merging there were no issues as both the branches didnt change same files
    2. In some cases the main branch and its sub-branch updates the same file so now there is a merge conflict as now which updated file we'll be choosing? These are called merge conflicts.


Commands related to branches:
    1. View current branch:
        git branch
    2. View all branches (Including remote)
        git branch -a 
    3. Create a new branch
        git branch <branch-name>
    4. Switch to a branch
        git switch <branch-name>
    5. Create and switch in one command
        git switch -c <branch-name>
        

MERGING BRANCHES:
    To merge a branch in the master branch you've to be in master branch first, then:
        git merge <branch-name>

Deleting a branch:
    git branch -d <branch-name>         [use "-D" if branch not merged yet, for force deletion]


RESOLVING MERGE CONFLICTS:
    If you're in main branch:
        ours = main branch
        theirs = other branch that you're dealing with

    Now you just resolve all the conflicted files by accepting either 'ours' or 'theirs' version one by one
        git checkout --ours <filename>
        git checkout --theirs <filename>

    After that you do [git add .] and [git commit -m "resolved conflict in filename/s"]

    


# RENAMING BRANCHES:
    git branch -m <new-name>
        - Renames the current branch 
    git branch -m <old-name> <new-name>  
        - Renames a different branch (that you're not in)
