Branches are created from master branch, they're basically copies of master branch which are worked on and later after the work (feature,etc) is done, is merged into the main branch, This can have further two more cases:
    1. Main branch got updated and its branch also got updated but while merging there were no issues as both the branches didnt change same files
    2. In some cases the main branch and its sub-branch updates the same file so now there is a merge conflict as now which updated file we'll be choosing? These are called merge conflicts.
