# from local machine to github

1. You've got your project somewhat going on your local computer.

2. You create a repo on the github and copy its link      [no license,gitignore,REAMDE.md file for now]

3. come to vscode and in your local machine directory:
    git remote add origin <repo-link>     
    git branch -M main  [renaming the master to main as in github, its main, not master.].
    git push origin main [pushing all the code to github repo].




# from github to local machine

    go to the directory by 'cd <filename>'  (Creating it first).

    git clone <repo-link>
