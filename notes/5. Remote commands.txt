    git remote -v      (shows the github repo you're connected to) (its name is set to origin by you as that name is kind of like a convention)

2. Add Remote:
    git remote add origin <website-link>

3. Change Remote:
    git remote set-url origin <website-link>

4. Remove Remote: (lets say origin)
    git remote remove origin
